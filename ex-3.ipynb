It is suitable for use in an introductory\\nprogramming course and for people who are trying to learn pro gramming on their own. There\\nare no prerequisites beyond a general familiarity with the i deas of computers and programs.\\nThere is enough material for a full year of college-level pro gramming. Chapters 1 through 7\\ncan be used as a textbook in a one-semester college-level cou rse or in a year-long high school\\ncourse.\\nThis version of the book covers “Java 5.0”, and many of the exa mples use features that were\\nnot present in earlier versions of Java. (Sometimes, you wil l see this version of Java referred\\nto as Java 1.5 instead of Java 5.0.) Note that Java applets app ear throughout the pages of the\\non-line version of this book. Many of those applets will be no n-functional in Web browsers that\\ndo not support Java 5.0.' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 12}\n",

That is, i t concentrates on explaining\\nconcepts rather than giving step-by-step how-to-do-it gui des. I have tried to use a conversational\\nwriting style that might be closer to classroom lecture than to a typical textbook. You’ll\\nﬁnd programming exercises at the end of most chapters, and yo u will ﬁnd a detailed solution\\nfor each exercise, with the sort of discussion that I would gi ve if I presented the solution in\\nclass. (Solutions to the exercises can be found in the on-lin e version only.) I strongly advise\\nthat you read the exercise solutions if you want to get the mos t out of this book.

This is\\ncertainly not a Java reference book, and it is not even close t o a comprehensive survey of all\\nthe features of Java. It is notwritten as a quick introduction to Java for people who alread y\\nknow another programming language. Instead, it is directed mainly towards people who are\\nlearning programming for the ﬁrst time, and it is as much abou t general programming concepts\\nas it is about Java in particular. I believe that Introduction to Programming using Java is\\nfully competitive with the conventionally published, prin ted programming textbooks that are\\navailable on the market. (Well, all right, I’ll confess that I think it’s better.)\\nThere are several approaches to teaching Java. One approach uses graphical user interface\\nprogramming from the very beginning.

This is notthe approach that I take. The\\napproach that I favor starts with the more basic building blo cks of programming and builds\\nfrom there. After an introductory chapter, I cover procedur al programming in Chapters 2, 3,\\nand 4. Object-oriented programming is introduced in Chapte r 5. Chapters 6 covers the closely\\nrelated topic of event-oriented programming and graphical user interfaces. Arrays are covered in\\nChapter 7.

Chapter 8 is mo stly about writing robust and\\ncorrect programs, but it also has a section on parallel proce ssing and threads.

But at the\\nheart—or the brain, if you want—of the computer is a single co mponent that does the actual\\ncomputing. This is the Central Processing Unit , or CPU. In a modern desktop computer,\\nthe CPU is a single “chip” on the order of one square inch in siz e. The job of the CPU is to\\nexecute programs.\\nAprogram is simply a list of unambiguous instructions meant to be foll owed mechanically\\nby a computer. A computer is built to carry out instructions t hat are written in a very simple\\ntype of language called machine language .

(It can execute programs written in other lan guages if they are ﬁrst translated\\ninto machine language.)\\nWhen the CPU executes a program, that program is stored in the computer’s main mem-\\nory(also called the RAM or random access memory). In addition to the program, memory\\ncan also hold data that is being used or processed by the progr am. Main memory consists of a\\nsequence of locations . These locations are numbered, and the sequence number of a l ocation\\nis called its address . An address provides a way of picking out one particular piec e of informa-\\ntion from among the millions stored in memory. When the CPU ne eds to access the program\\ninstruction or data in a particular location, it sends the ad dress of that information as a sig-\\nnal to the memory; the memory responds by sending back the dat a contained in the speciﬁed\\n1' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 16}\n",

The CPU can also store information in memory by spe cifying the information to be\\nstored and the address of the location where it is to be stored .\\nOn the level of machine language, the operation of the CPU is f airly straightforward (al-\\nthough it is very complicated in detail). The CPU executes a p rogram that is stored as a\\nsequence of machine language instructions in main memory. I t does this by repeatedly reading,\\norfetching , an instruction from memory and then carrying out, or executing , that instruc-\\ntion. This process—fetch an instruction, execute it, fetch another instruction, execute it, and so\\non forever—is called the fetch-and-execute cycle . With one exception, which will be covered\\nin the next section, this is all that the CPU ever does.\\nThe details of the fetch-and-execute cycle are not terribly important, but there are a few\\nbasic things you should know.

The CPU\\nuses one of these registers—the program counter , or PC—to keep track of where it is in the\\nprogram it is executing. The PC stores the address of the next instruction that the CPU should\\nexecute. At the beginning of each fetch-and-execute cycle, the CPU checks the PC to see which\\ninstruction it should fetch. During the course of the fetch- and-execute cycle, the number in the\\nPC is updated to indicate the instruction that is to be execut ed in the next cycle.

The CPU can waste\\nan awful lot of time just waiting for input.\\nTo avoid this ineﬃciency, interrupts are often used instead of polling. An interrupt is\\na signal sent by another device to the CPU. The CPU responds to an interrupt signal by\\nputting aside whatever it is doing in order to respond to the i nterrupt. Once it has handled\\nthe interrupt, it returns to what it was doing before the inte rrupt occurred.

The CPU is built so that when that wire is turned on,\\nthe CPU saves enough information about what it is currently d oing so that it can return to\\nthe same state later.

The class is a type—in the technical sense of a speciﬁcation of a certain type of data\\nvalue—and the object is a value of that type. For example, String is actually the name of a' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 44}\n",

For example, String is actually the name of a\\nclass that is included as a standard part of the Java language .String is also a type, and literal\\nstrings such as \"Hello World\" represent values of type String .\\nSo, every subroutine is contained either in a class or in an ob ject. Classes contain subrou-\\ntines called static member subroutines. Classes also describe objects and the subroutines that\\nare contained in those objects.\\nThis dual use can be confusing, and in practice most classes a re designed to perform pri-\\nmarily or exclusively in only one of the two possible roles.

That object contains data, namely the sequence of characters\\nthat make up the string. It also contains subroutines. All of these subroutines are in fact\\nfunctions.

      "--- Page 183 ---\n",
      "page_content='2.3. OBJECTS AND SUBROUTINES 33\\nThenadvice.length() is a function call that returns the number of characters in th e string\\n“Seize the day!”. In this case, the return value would be 14. I n general, for any string variable\\nstr, the value of str.length() is anintequal to the number of characters in the string that is\\nthe value of str. Note that this function has no parameter; the particular st ring whose length\\nis being computed is the value of str. Thelength subroutine is deﬁned by the class String ,\\nand it can be used with any value of type String . It can even be used with String literals, which\\nare, after all, just constant values of type String . For example, you could have a program count\\nthe characters in “Hello World” for you by saying\\nSystem.out.print(\"The number of characters in \");\\nSystem.out.println(\"the string \\\\\"Hello World\\\\\" is \");\\nSystem.out.println( \"Hello World\".length() );\\nTheString class deﬁnes a lot of functions.

To change the value of s1, you could use an\\nassignment “ s1 = s1.toLowerCase(); ”.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nHere is another extremely useful fact about strings: You can use the plus operator, +, to\\nconcatenate two strings.

You’ve already seen that output can b e displayed to the user\\nusing the subroutine System.out.print . This subroutine is part of a pre-deﬁned object called\\nSystem.out . The purpose of this object is precisely to display output to the user. There is\\na corresponding object called System.in that exists to read data input by the user, but it\\nprovides only very primitive input facilities, and it requi res some advanced Java programming\\nskills to use it eﬀectively.\\nJava 5.0 ﬁnally makes input a little easier with a new Scanner class.

The subroutine s in this class make it possible\\nto get input from the standard input object, System.in , without knowing about the advanced\\naspects of Java that are needed to use Scanner or to use System.in directly. TextIO also\\ncontains a set of output subroutines. The output subroutine s are similar to those provided in\\nSystem.out , but they provide a few additional features. You can use whic hever set of output\\nsubroutines you prefer, and you can even mix them in the same p rogram.\\nTo use the TextIO class, you must make sure that the class is available to your p rogram.\\nWhat this means depends on the Java programming environment that you are using.

(Static member function s\\nwere introduced in the previous section.) Let’s suppose tha t you want your program to read\\nan integer typed in by the user. The TextIO class contains a static member function named\\ngetlnInt that you can use for this purpose. Since this function is cont ained in the TextIO class,\\nyou have to refer to it in your program as TextIO.getlnInt . The function has no parameters,\\nso a complete call to the function takes the form “ TextIO.getlnInt() ”. This function call\\nrepresents the intvalue typed by the user, and you have to do something with the r eturned\\nvalue, such as assign it to a variable. For example, if userInput is a variable of type int' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 52}\n",

The value typed will be returned by the function, and i t will be stored in the variable,\\nuserInput . Here is a complete program that uses TextIO.getlnInt to read a number typed\\nby the user and then prints out the square of the number that th e user types:\\n/**\\n* A program that reads an integer that is typed in by the\\n* user and computes and prints the square of that integer.\\n*/\\npublic class PrintSquare {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nint userInput; // The number input by the user.\\nint square; // The userInput, multiplied by itself.\\nSystem.out.print(\"Please type a number: \");\\nuserInput = TextIO.getlnInt();\\nsquare = userInput * userInput;' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 52}\n",

Recall that an expression is a piece of\\nprogram code that represents or computes a value. An express ion can be a literal, a variable,\\na function call, or several of these things combined with ope rators such as +and>. The value\\nof an expression can be assigned to a variable, used as a param eter in a subroutine call, or\\ncombined with other values into a more complicated expressi on. (The value can even, in some\\ncases, be ignored, if that’s what you want to do; this is more c ommon than you might think.)' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 59}\n",

DETAILS OF EXPRESSIONS 45\\nTheMath class also contains a couple of mathematical constants that are useful in math-\\nematical expressions: Math.PI represents π(the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its\\ndiameter), and Math.E represents e(the base of the natural logarithms). These “constants”\\nare actually member variables in Math of type double . They are only approximations for the\\nmathematical constants, which would require an inﬁnite num ber of digits to specify exactly.\\nLiterals, variables, and function calls are simple express ions. More complex expressions\\ncan be built up by using operators to combine simpler expressions. Operators include +for\\nadding two numbers, >for comparing two values, and so on. When several operators a ppear\\nin an expression, there is a question of precedence , which determines how the operators are\\ngrouped for evaluation.

We say that multiplication ( *) hashigher precedence\\nthan addition ( +). If the default precedence is not what you want, you can use p arentheses to\\nexplicitly specify the grouping you want. For example, you c ould use “ (A + B) * C ” if you\\nwant to add AtoBﬁrst and then multiply the result by C.\\nThe rest of this section gives details of operators in Java.

If your program tells\\nthe computer to combine two values of diﬀerent types, the com puter will convert one of the\\nvalues from one type to another. For example, to compute 37.4 + 10, the computer will convert\\nthe integer 10 to a real number 10.0 and will then compute 37.4 + 10.0. This is called a type\\nconversion . Ordinarily, you don’t have to worry about type conversion i n expressions, because\\nthe computer does it automatically.\\nWhen two numerical values are combined (after doing type con version on one of them, if\\nnecessary), the answer will be of the same type. If you multip ly two ints, you get an int; if you\\nmultiply two double s, you get a double . This is what you would expect, but you have to be\\nvery careful when you use the division operator /.

This fact is a common source of programming errors. You\\ncan force the computer to compute a real number as the answer b y making one of the operands\\nreal: For example, when the computer evaluates 1.0/N , it ﬁrst converts Nto a real number in\\norder to match the type of 1.0, so you get a real number as the answer.\\nJava also has an operator for computing the remainder when on e integer is divided by\\nanother.

The operators ++and--are called the increment\\noperator and the decrement operator, respectively.

Thus, if the value of xis6, the statement “ y\\n= x++ ;” will change the value of xto7, but it will change the value of yto6since the value\\nassigned to yis theoldvalue ofx. On the other hand, the value of ++xis deﬁned to be the\\nnewvalue ofx, after the 1is added. So if xis6, then the statement “ y = ++x ;” changes the\\nvalues of both xandyto7. The decrement operator, --, works in a similar way.\\nThis can be confusing. My advice is: Don’t be confused. Use ++and--only in stand-alone\\nstatements, not in expressions.

(The -31072 is obtained by taking the 4-byte int100000 and throwing\\naway two of those bytes to obtain a short—you’ve lost the real information that was in those\\ntwo bytes.)\\nAs another example of type casts, consider the problem of get ting a random integer between\\n1 and 6. The function Math.random() gives a real number between 0.0 and 0.9999. . ., and so\\n6*Math.random() is between 0.0 and 5.999. ... The type-cast operator, (int) , can be used to\\nconvert this to an integer: (int)(6*Math.random()) . A real number is cast to an integer by\\ndiscarding the fractional part. Thus, (int)(6*Math.random()) is one of the integers 0, 1, 2, 3,\\n4, and 5.

NAMES AND THINGS\\n2.5.7 Type Conversion of Strings\\nIn addition to automatic type conversions and explicit type casts, there are some other cases\\nwhere you might want to convert a value of one type into a value of a diﬀerent type. One\\ncommon example is the conversion of a String value into some other type, such as converting\\nthe string \"10\"into the intvalue 10 or the string \"17.42e-2\" into the double value 0.1742. In\\nJava, these conversions are handled by built-in functions.\\nThere is a standard class named Integer that contains several subroutines and variables\\nrelated to the intdata type. (Recall that since intis not a class, intitself can’t contain\\nany subroutines or variables.) In particular, if stris any expression of type String , then\\nInteger.parseInt(str) is a function call that attempts to convert the value of strinto a\\nvalue of type int. For example, the value of Integer.parseInt(\"10\") is the intvalue 10. If' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 65}\n",

If\\nthe parameter to Integer.parseInt does not represent a legal intvalue, then an error occurs.\\nSimilarly, the standard class named Double includes a function Double.parseDouble that\\ntries to convert a parameter of type String into a value of type double . For example, the\\nvalue of the function call Double.parseDouble(\"3.14\") is the double value 3.14. (Of course,\\nin practice, the parameter used in Double.parseDouble orInteger.parseInt would be a\\nvariable or expression rather than a constant string.)\\nType conversion functions also exist for converting string s into enumerated type values.\\n(Enumerated types, or enums, were introduced in Subsection 2.3.3.) For any enum type, a\\npredeﬁned function named valueOf is automatically deﬁned for that type. This is a function\\nthat takes a string as parameter and tries to convert it to a va lue belonging to the enum. The' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 65}\n",

For the\\nconversion to succeed, the string must exactly match the sim ple name of one of the enumerated\\ntype constants ( without the “Suit.” in front).\\n2.5.8 Precedence Rules\\nIf you use several operators in one expression, and if you don ’t use parentheses to explicitly\\nindicate the order of evaluation, then you have to worry abou t the precedence rules that deter-\\nmine the order of evaluation.

In Java , there are just six such structures\\nthat are used to determine the normal ﬂow of control in a progr am—and, in fact, just three\\nof them would be enough to write programs to perform any task. The six control structures\\nare: the block , thewhile loop , thedo..while loop , thefor loop , theif statement , and the\\nswitch statement .

CONTROL\\nThat is, it consists of a sequence of statements enclosed bet ween a pair of braces, “ {” and “}”.\\n(In fact, it is possible for a block to contain no statements a t all; such a block is called an\\nempty block , and can actually be useful at times. An empty block consists of nothing but\\nan empty pair of braces.) Block statements usually occur ins ide other statements, where their\\npurpose is to group together several statements into a unit. However, a block can be legally\\nused wherever a statement can occur. There is one place where a block is required: As you\\nmight have already noticed in the case of the mainsubroutine of a program, the deﬁnition of a\\nsubroutine is a block, since it is a sequence of statements en closed inside a pair of braces.\\nI should probably note again at this point that Java is what is called a free-format language.\\nThere are no syntax rules about how the language has to be arra nged on a page.

In general, this means putting one statem ent per line and using indentation\\nto indicate statements that are contained inside control st ructures. This is the format that I\\nwill generally use in my examples.\\nHere are two examples of blocks:\\n{\\nSystem.out.print(\"The answer is \");\\nSystem.out.println(ans);\\n}\\n{ // This block exchanges the values of x and y\\nint temp; // A temporary variable for use in this block.\\ntemp = x; // Save a copy of the value of x in temp.\\nx = y; // Copy the value of y into x.\\ny = temp; // Copy the value of temp into y.\\n}\\nIn the second example, a variable, temp, is declared inside the block.

A variable declared inside a block is co mpletely inaccessible and invisible\\nfrom outside that block. When the computer executes the vari able declaration statement, it\\nallocates memory to hold the value of the variable. When the b lock ends, that memory is\\ndiscarded (that is, made available for reuse). The variable is said to be local to the block.\\nThere is a general concept called the “scope” of an identiﬁer . Thescope of an identiﬁer is the\\npart of the program in which that identiﬁer is valid. The scop e of a variable deﬁned inside a\\nblock is limited to that block, and more speciﬁcally to the pa rt of the block that comes after\\nthe declaration of the variable.\\n3.1.2 The Basic While Loop' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 77}\n",

This boolean expression is\\ncalled the continuation condition , or more simply the test, of the loop. There are a few\\npoints that might need some clariﬁcation. What happens if th e condition is false in the ﬁrst\\nplace, before the body of the loop is executed even once? In th at case, the body of the loop is\\nnever executed at all.

What happens if the condition is true, but it becomes fa lse somewhere in the middle of\\nthe loop body? Does the loop end as soon as this happens? It doe sn’t, because the computer\\ncontinues executing the body of the loop until it gets to the e nd. Only then does it jump back\\nto the beginning of the loop and test the condition, and only t hen can the loop end.\\nLet’s look at a typical problem that can be solved using a while loop: ﬁnding the average\\nof a set of positive integers entered by the user. The average is the sum of the integers, divided\\nby the number of integers. The program will ask the user to ent er one integer at a time. It\\nwill keep count of the number of integers entered, and it will keep a running total of all the\\nnumbers it has read so far. Here is a pseudocode algorithm for the program:\\nLet sum = 0\\nLet count = 0\\nwhile there are more integers to process:\\nRead an integer' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 89}\n",

It’s just there t o mark the end of the real data.\\nA data value used in this way is sometimes called a sentinel value . So now the test in the\\nwhile loop becomes “while the input integer is not zero”. But there is another problem!

If a common character is\\nfound, the value of the ﬂag variable nothingInCommon is set tofalse , and a labeled break is\\nis used to end the processing at that point:\\nboolean nothingInCommon;\\nnothingInCommon = true; // Assume s1 and s2 have no chars in co mmon.\\nint i,j; // Variables for iterating through the chars in s1 an d s2.\\ni = 0;' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 94}\n",

A continue state-\\nment tells the computer to skip the rest of the current iterat ion of the loop. However, instead\\nof jumping out of the loop altogether, it jumps back to the beg inning of the loop and continues\\nwith the next iteration (including evaluating the loop’s co ntinuation condition to see whether\\nany further iterations are required).

THE FOR STATEMENT 81\\nUsually, the initialization part of a forstatement assigns a value to some variable, and the\\nupdate changes the value of that variable with an assignment statement or with an increment\\nor decrement operation. The value of the variable is tested i n the continuation condition, and\\nthe loop ends when this condition evaluates to false . A variable used in this way is called a\\nloop control variable . In theforstatement given above, the loop control variable is years .\\nCertainly, the most common type of forloop is the counting loop , where a loop control\\nvariable takes on all integer values between some minimum an d some maximum value.

The forloop at the beginning of this section is a counting\\nloop in which the loop control variable, years , takes on the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

The&&operator can only be used between boolean\\nvalues, so you have to make separate tests, x<yandx<z, and then combine the two tests with\\n&&.\\nThere is an alternative approach to this problem that begins by asking, “which order should\\nxandybe printed in?” Once that’s known, you only have to decide whe re to stick in z.

Occasionally, you might ﬁnd yourself using the e mpty statement\\nwhen what you mean is, in fact, “do nothing”. For example, the rather contrived ifstatement\\nif ( done )\\n; // Empty statement\\nelse\\nSystem.out.println( \"Not done yet. );' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 110}\n",

However, there is another quirk in the syn-\\ntax: when an enum constant is used in a caselabel, only the simple name, such as “ SPRING ”\\ncan be used, not the full name “ Season.SPRING ”. Of course, the computer already knows that\\nthe value in the caselabel must belong to the enumerated type, since it can tell th at from the\\ntype of expression used, so there is really no need to specify the type name in the constant.

This means that the computer\\nmust be able to prove, just from looking at the code when the pr ogram is compiled, that the\\nvariable must have been assigned a value.

For example, if a subroutine requires that a par ameter be greater than or equal to\\nzero, an IllegalArgumentException might occur when a negative value is passed to the subroutine .\\nHow to respond to the illegal value is up to the person who wrot e the subroutine, so we\\ncan’t simply say that every illegal parameter value will res ult in an IllegalArgumentException .\\nHowever, it is a common response.\\nOne case where an IllegalArgumentException can occur is in the valueOf function of an\\nenumerated type.

For example, we say that\\nInteger.parseInt(str) throws an exception of type NumberFormatException when the value\\nofstris illegal. When an exception is thrown, it is possible to “ca tch” the exception and\\nprevent it from crashing the program. This is done with a try..catch statement. In somewhat\\nsimpliﬁed form, the syntax for a try..catch is:\\ntry {\\n/angbracketleftstatements-1 /angbracketright\\n}' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 116}\n",

These built-in classes include System andMath. If you want to use one of these classes,\\nyou don’t have to do anything special. You just go ahead and us e it. But Java also has a large\\nnumber of standard classes that are there if you want them but that are not automatically\\navailable to your program. (There are just too many of them.) If you want to use these\\nclasses in your program, you have to ask for them ﬁrst. The sta ndard classes are grouped\\ninto so-called “packages.” Two of these packages are called “java.awt” and “java.applet”.

I nstead of being static members of a\\nclass, the subroutines that deﬁne the applet’s behavior are part of the applet object. We say\\nthat they are “non-static” subroutines.

Many objects can be described\\nby the same class. Each object has its own non-static subrout ine. But the common deﬁnition\\nof those subroutines—the actual Java source code—is physic ally part of the class that describes\\nall the objects. To put it brieﬂy: static subroutines in a cla ss deﬁnition say what the class does;\\nnon-static subroutines say what all the objects described b y the class do. An applet’s paint()\\nroutine is an example of a non-static subroutine. A stand-al one program’s main() routine is an\\nexample of a static subroutine. The distinction doesn’t rea lly matter too much at this point:\\nWhen working with stand-alone programs, mark everything wi th the reserved word, “ static ”;\\nleave it out when working with applets.

For example, the contrac t of the built-in subroutine\\nDouble.parseDouble says that the parameter should be a string representation of a num-\\nber of type double ; if this is true, then the subroutine will convert the string into the equivalent\\nnumeric value. If the caller violates the contract by passin g an invalid string as the actual\\nparameter, the subroutine responds by throwing an exceptio n of type NumberFormatException .\\nMany subroutines throw IllegalArgumentExceptions in response to bad parameter values.\\nYou might want to take this response in your own subroutines.

This memory\\nmust be initialized to contain some deﬁnite value before the variable can be used in an expres-\\nsion. In the case of a local variable, the declaration is ofte n followed closely by an assignment\\nstatement that does the initialization. For example,\\nint count; // Declare a variable named count.\\ncount = 0; // Give count its initial value.\\nHowever, the truth about declaration statements is that it i s legal to include the initializa-\\ntion of the variable in the declaration statement. The two st atements above can therefore be\\nabbreviated as\\nint count = 0; // Declare count and give it an initial value.\\nThe computer still executes this statement in two steps: Dec lare the variable count , then assign\\nthe value 0 to the newly created variable.

It is legal to initialize several vari ables in one declaration statement.\\nFor example,\\nchar firstInitial = ’D’, secondInitial = ’E’;\\nint x, y = 1; // OK, but only y has been initialized!\\nint N = 3, M = N+2; // OK, N is initialized\\n// before its value is used.\\nThis feature is especially common in forloops, since it makes it possible to declare a loop control\\nvariable at the same point in the loop where it is initialized . Since the loop control variable\\ngenerally has nothing to do with the rest of the program outsi de the loop, it’s reasonable to\\nhave its declaration in the part of the program where it’s act ually used. For example:\\nfor ( int i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {\\nSystem.out.println(i);\\n}\\nAgain, you should remember that this is simply an abbreviati on for the following, where I’ve' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 169}\n",

See Subsec-\\ntion 3.4.4.)\\nA member variable can also be initialized at the point where i t is declared, just as for a\\nlocal variable.

For example,\\nin the above example where interestRate is initialized to the value 0.05, it’s quite possible\\nthat that is meant to be the value throughout the entire progr am. In this case, the programmer\\nis probably deﬁning the variable, interestRate , to give a meaningful name to the otherwise\\nmeaningless number, 0.05. It’s easier to understand what’s going on when a program say s\\n“principal += principal*interestRate; ”rather than “ principal += principal*0.05; ”.\\nIn Java, the modiﬁer “ final ” can be applied to a variable declaration to ensure that the\\nvalue stored in the variable cannot be changed after the vari able has been initialized.

The portion of the pro gram source code where the\\nvariable name is valid is called the scope of the variable. Similarly, we can refer to the scope\\nof subroutine names and formal parameter names.\\nFor static member subroutines, scope is straightforward.

It is even pos sible to call a subroutine from\\nwithin itself. This is an example of something called “recur sion,” a fairly advanced topic that\\nwe will return to later.\\nFor a variable that is declared as a static member variable in a class, the situation is similar,\\nbut with one complication. It is legal to have a local variabl e or a formal parameter that has\\nthe same name as a member variable. In that case, within the sc ope of the local variable or\\nparameter, the member variable is hidden .

Recall\\nthat making a member of a class public makes it accessible from anywhere, including from\\nother classes. On the other hand, a private member can only be used in the class where it is\\ndeﬁned.\\nIn the opinion of many programmers, almost all member variab les should be declared\\nprivate . This gives you complete control over what can be done with th e variable. Even\\nif the variable itself is private, you can allow other classe s to ﬁnd out what its value is by pro-\\nviding apublic accessor method that returns the value of the variable. For example, if your' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 187}\n",

      "--- Page 675 ---\n",
      "page_content='viding apublic accessor method that returns the value of the variable. For example, if your\\nclass contains a private member variable, title , of type String , you can provide a method\\npublic String getTitle() {\\nreturn title;\\n}\\nthat returns the value of title . By convention, the name of an accessor method for a variable\\nis obtained by capitalizing the name of variable and adding “ get” in front of the name. So, for\\nthe variable title , we get an accessor method named “get” +“Title”, or getTitle() . Because\\nof this naming convention, accessor methods are more often r eferred to as getter methods . A\\ngetter method provides “read access” to a variable.\\nYou might also want to allow “write access” to a private variable. That is, you might\\nwant to make it possible for other classes to specify a new val ue for the variable. This is done\\nwith a setter method .

The name of a setter method should consist of “set” followe d by a\\ncapitalized copy of the variable’s name, and it should have a parameter with the same type as\\nthe variable. A setter method for the variable title could be written\\npublic void setTitle( String newTitle ) {\\ntitle = newTitle;\\n}\\nIt is actually very common to provide both a getter and a sette r method for a private\\nmember variable. Since this allows other classes both to see and to change the value of the\\nvariable, you might wonder why not just make the variable public ? The reason is that getters\\nand setters are not restricted to simply reading and writing the variable’s value. In fact, they\\ncan take any action at all.

Some of these classes are meant to be extended to produce\\nnew classes, while others can be used directly to create usef ul objects.

Copying the string takes some time. Building up a long string letter by letter\\nwould require a surprising amount of processing. The class StringBuﬀer makes it possible to be\\neﬃcient about building up a long string from a number of small er pieces. To do this, you must\\nmake an object belonging to the StringBuﬀer class. For example:\\nStringBuffer buffer = new StringBuffer();' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 195}\n",

For example, this package\\ncontains classes for working with collections of objects. W e will study these collection classes in\\nChapter 10. Another class in this package, java.util.Date , is used to represent times.

An object of type Random can also be used to generate\\nso-called Gaussian distributed random real numbers.\\nThe main point here, again, is that many problems have alread y been solved, and the\\nsolutions are available in Java’s standard classes.

You\\ncan’t do that literally, but you can “wrap” the primitive typ e value in an object belonging to\\none of the wrapper classes.\\nFor example, an object of type Double contains a single instance variable, of type double .\\nThe object is a wrapper for the double value.

(As an example of where this would be useful, the\\ncollection classes that will be studied in Chapter 10 can onl y hold objects. If you want to add\\na primitive type value to a collection, it has to be put into a w rapper object ﬁrst.)\\nIn Java 5.0, wrapper classes have become easier to use. Java 5 .0 introduced automatic\\nconversion between a primitive type and the corresponding w rapper class. For example, if\\nyou use a value of type intin a context that requires an object of type Integer , theintwill\\nautomatically be wrapped in an Integer object.

Autoboxing and unboxing also apply\\nto subroutine calls. For example, you can pass an actual para meter of type intto a subroutine\\nthat has a formal parameter of type Integer . In fact, autoboxing and unboxing make it possible\\nin many circumstances to ignore the diﬀerence between primi tive types and objects.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe wrapper classes contain a few other things that deserve t o be mentioned.

This is the closest they can get without actually being\\nequal to zero.\\nThe class Double deserves special mention, since double s are so much more complicated than\\nintegers. The encoding of real numbers into values of type double has room for a few special val-\\nues that are not real numbers at all in the mathematical sense .

This is a powerful idea. However , something like this can be done\\nin most programming languages. The central new idea in objec t-oriented programming—the\\nidea that really distinguishes it from traditional program ming—is to allow classes to express\\nthe similarities among objects that share some , but not all, of their structure and behavior.\\nSuch similarities can be expressed using inheritance andpolymorphism .\\n5.5.1 Extending Existing Classes' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 209}\n",

The rules are\\nas follows: The value of a hand is obtained by adding up the val ues of the cards in the hand.\\nThe value of a numeric card such as a three or a ten is its numeri cal value.

There is one more access modiﬁer, protected , that comes into the picture when subclasses\\nare taken into consideration. When protected is applied as an access modiﬁer to a method or\\nmember variable in a class, that member can be used in subclas ses—direcct or indirect—of the\\nclass in which it is deﬁned, but it cannot be used in non-subcl asses. (There is one exception:\\nAprotected member can also be accessed by any class in the same package as the class that\\ncontains the protected member. Recall that using no access m odiﬁer makes a member accessible\\nto classes in the same package, and nowhere else. Using the protected modiﬁer is strictly more' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 211}\n",

Using the protected modiﬁer is strictly more\\nliberal than using no modiﬁer at all: It allows access from cl asses in the same package and from\\nsubclasses that are not in the same package.)\\nWhen you declare a method or member variable to be protected , you are saying that it\\nis part of the implementation of the class, rather than part o f the public interface of the class.\\nHowever, you are allowing subclasses to use and modify that p art of the implementation.\\nFor example, consider a PairOfDice class that has instance variables die1 anddie2 to\\nrepresent the numbers appearing on the two dice. We could mak e those variables private to\\nmake it impossible to change their values from outside the cl ass, while still allowing read access\\nthrough getter methods. However, if we think it possible tha tPairOfDice will be used to create\\nsubclasses, we might want to make it possible for subclasses to change the numbers on the dice.' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 211}\n",

A subclass can add to the\\nstructure and behavior that it inherits. It can also replace or modify inherited behavior (though\\nnot inherited structure).

The subclasses, which\\nmight be referred to as “sibling classes,” share some struct ures and behaviors—namely, the ones\\nthey inherit from their common superclass.

A GUI program oﬀers a much richer type of user interfac e, where the user uses a mouse\\nand keyboard to interact with GUI components such as windows , menus, buttons, check boxes,\\ntext input boxes, scroll bars, and so on. The main routine of a GUI program creates one or\\nmore such components and displays them on the computer scree n. Very often, that’s all it does.\\nOnce a GUI component has been created, it follows its ownprogramming—programming that\\ntells it how to draw itself on the screen and how to respond to e vents such as being clicked on\\nby the user.\\nA GUI program doesn’t have to be immensely complex. We can, fo r example, write a very\\nsimple GUI “Hello World” program that says “Hello” to the use r, but does it by opening a\\nwindow where the the greeting is displayed:\\nimport javax.swing.JOptionPane;\\npublic class HelloWorldGUI1 {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nJOptionPane.showMessageDialog( null, \"Hello World!\" );\\n}\\n}' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 241}\n",

      "page_content='public class HelloWorldGUI1 {\\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\\nJOptionPane.showMessageDialog( null, \"Hello World!\" );\\n}\\n}\\nWhen this program is run, a window appears on the screen that c ontains the message\\n“Hello World!”. The window also contains an “OK” button for t he user to click after reading\\nthe message. When the user clicks this button, the window clo ses and the program ends. By\\nthe way, this program can be placed in a ﬁle named HelloWorldGUI1.java , compiled, and run\\njust like any other Java program.\\nNow, this program is already doing some pretty fancy stuﬀ. It creates a window, it draws\\nthe contents of that window, and it handles the event that is g enerated when the user clicks\\nthe button. The reason the program was so easy to write is that all the work is done by\\nshowMessageDialog() , astatic method in the built-in class JOptionPane . (Note that the\\nsource code “imports” the class javax.swing.JOptionPane to make it possible to refer to the' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 241}\n",

Of course, if you\\nwant to do anything serious in a GUI program, there is a lot mor e to learn. To give you an idea\\nof the types of things that are involved, we’ll look at a short GUI program that does the same\\nthings as the previous program—open a window containing a me ssage and an OK button, and\\nrespond to a click on the button by ending the program—but doe s it all by hand instead of by\\nusing the built-in JOptionPane class.

One of the most fundamental types of component i s thewindow . Windows have\\nmany behaviors. They can be opened and closed. They can be res ized. They have “titles” that\\nare displayed in the title bar above the window. And most impo rtant, they can contain other\\nGUI components such as buttons and menus.\\nJava, of course, has a built-in class to represent windows. T here are actually several diﬀerent\\ntypes of window, but the most common type is represented by th eJFrame class (which is\\nincluded in the package javax.swing ). A JFrame is an independent window that can, for\\nexample, act as the main window of an application. One of the m ost important things to\\nunderstand is that a JFrame object comes with many of the behaviors of windows already\\nprogrammed in. In particular, it comes with the basic proper ties shared by all windows, such' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 242}\n",

Since a JFrame comes with these behaviors,\\nyou don’t have to program them yourself! This is, of course, o ne of the central ideas of object-\\noriented programming. What a JFrame doesn’t come with, of course, is content , the stuﬀ that\\nis contained in the window. If you don’t add any other content to aJFrame , it will just display\\na large blank area.

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\nThe main program above declares a variable, window , of type JFrame and sets it to refer to\\na new window object with the statement:\\nJFrame window = new JFrame(\"GUI Test\");\\nThe parameter in the constructor, “GUI Test”, speciﬁes the t itle that will be displayed in the\\ntitlebar of the window. This line creates the window object, but the window itself is not yet\\nvisible on the screen. Before making the window visible, som e of its properties are set with\\nthese statements:\\nwindow.setContentPane(content);\\nwindow.setSize(250,100);\\nwindow.setLocation(100,100);\\nThe ﬁrst line here sets the content of the window. (The conten t itself was created earlier in the\\nmain program.) The second line says that the window will be 25 0 pixels wide and 100 pixels\\nhigh. The third line says that the upper left corner of the win dow will be 100 pixels over from\\nthe left edge of the screen and 100 pixels down from the top.

On ce all this has been set up, the\\nwindow is actually made visible on the screen with the comman d:\\nwindow.setVisible(true);\\nIt might look as if the program ends at that point, and, in fact , themain() routine does end.\\nHowever, the the window is still on the screen and the program as a whole does not end until\\nthe user clicks the OK button.\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nThe content that is displayed in a JFrame is called its content pane . (In addition to its\\ncontent pane, a JFrame can also have a menu bar, which is a separate thing that I will t alk\\nabout later.) A basic JFrame already has a blank content pane; you can either add things\\nto that pane or you can replace the basic content pane entirel y. In my sample program,\\nthe linewindow.setContentPane(content) replaces the original blank content pane with a\\ndiﬀerent component. (Remember that a “component” is just a v isual element of a graphical' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 243}\n",

In this case, the new content is a component of type JPanel .\\nJPanel is another of the fundamental classes in Swing. The basic JPanel is, again, just\\na blank rectangle. There are two ways to make a useful JPanel : The ﬁrst is to add other\\ncomponents to the panel; the second is to draw something in the panel. Both of these\\ntechniques are illustrated in the sample program. In fact, y ou will ﬁnd two JPanel s in the\\nprogram: content , which is used to contain other components, and displayPanel , which is\\nused as a drawing surface.\\nLet’s look more closely at displayPanel . This variable is of type HelloWorldDisplay , which\\nis a nested static class inside the HelloWorldGUI2 class. (Nested classes were introduced in\\nSubsection 5.7.2.) This class deﬁnes just one instance meth od,paintComponent() , which\\noverrides a method of the same name in the JPanel class:' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 243}\n",

This calls the version of paintComponent() that is deﬁned in\\nthe superclass, JPanel ; that is, it ﬁlls the panel with the background color. (See Su bsection 5.6.2\\nfor a discussion of the special variable super .) Then it calls g.drawString() to paint the string\\n“Hello World!” onto the panel. The net result is that wheneve r aHelloWorldDisplay is shown\\non the screen, it displays the string “Hello World!”.\\nWe will often use JPanel s in this way, as drawing surfaces. Usually, when we do this, w e will\\ndeﬁne a nested class that is a subclass of JPanel and we will write a paintComponent method\\nin that class to draw the desired content in the panel.\\n6.1.2 Components and Layout\\nAnother way of using a JPanel is as a container to hold other components.

      "page_content='6.1.2 Components and Layout\\nAnother way of using a JPanel is as a container to hold other components. Java has many\\nclasses that deﬁne GUI components. Before these components can appear on the screen, they\\nmust be added to a container. In this program, the variable named content refers to a JPanel\\nthat is used as a container, and two other components are adde d to that container. This is\\ndone in the statements:\\ncontent.add(displayPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER);\\ncontent.add(okButton, BorderLayout.SOUTH);\\nHere,content refers to an object of type JPanel ; later in the program, this panel becomes the\\ncontent pane of the window. The ﬁrst component that is added t ocontent isdisplayPanel\\nwhich, as discussed above, displays the message, “Hello Wor ld!”. The second is okButton which\\nrepresents the button that the user clicks to close the windo w.

When components are added to a con tainer, there has to be some way\\nof deciding how those components are arranged inside the con tainer. This is called “laying out”\\nthe components in the container, and the most common techniq ue for laying out components\\nis to use a layout manager . A layout manager is an object that implements some policy fo r\\nhow to arrange the components in a container; diﬀerent types of layout manager implement\\ndiﬀerent policies. One type of layout manager is deﬁned by th eBorderLayout class. In the\\nprogram, the statement\\ncontent.setLayout(new BorderLayout());\\ncreates a new BorderLayout object and tells the content panel to use the new object as its layout\\nmanager. Essentially, this line determines how components that are added to the content panel' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 244}\n",

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\n6.1.3 Events and Listeners\\nThe structure of containers and components sets up the physi cal appearance of a GUI, but\\nit doesn’t say anything about how the GUI behaves . That is, what can the user do to the\\nGUI and how will it respond? GUIs are largely event-driven ; that is, the program waits\\nfor events that are generated by the user’s actions (or by som e other cause). When an event\\noccurs, the program responds by executing an event-handling method . In order to program\\nthe behavior of a GUI, you have to write event-handling metho ds to respond to the events that\\nyou are interested in.\\nThe most common technique for handling events in Java is to us eevent listeners . A\\nlistener is an object that includes one or more event-handli ng methods. When an event is\\ndetected by another object, such as a button or menu, the list ener object is notiﬁed and it' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 245}\n",

      "--- Page 880 ---\n",
      "page_content='detected by another object, such as a button or menu, the list ener object is notiﬁed and it\\nresponds by running the appropriate event-handling method . An event is detected or generated\\nby an object. Another object, the listener, has the responsi bility of responding to the event.\\nThe event itself is actually represented by a third object, w hich carries information about the\\ntype of event, when it occurred, and so on. This division of re sponsibilities makes it easier to\\norganize large programs.\\nAs an example, consider the OK button in the sample program. W hen the user clicks the\\nbutton, an event is generated. This event is represented by a n object belonging to the class\\nActionEvent . The event that is generated is associated with the button; w e say that the button\\nis thesource of the event. The listener object in this case is an object bel onging to the class\\nButtonHandler , which is deﬁned as a nested class inside HelloWorldGUI2 :' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 245}\n",

(Interfaces were introduced in Subsection 5.7.1.) The event-\\nhandling method is named actionPerformed , as speciﬁed by the ActionListener interface. This\\nmethod contains the code that is executed when the user click s the button; in this case, the\\ncode is a call to System.exit() , which will terminate the program.\\nThere is one more ingredient that is necessary to get the even t from the button to the\\nlistener object: The listener object must register itself with the button as an event listener.\\nThis is done with the statement:\\nokButton.addActionListener(listener);\\nThis statement tells okButton that when the user clicks the button, the ActionEvent that is' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 245}\n",

      "page_content='okButton.addActionListener(listener);\\nThis statement tells okButton that when the user clicks the button, the ActionEvent that is\\ngenerated should be sent to listener . Without this statement, the button has no way of\\nknowing that some other object would like to listen for event s from the button.\\nThis example shows a general technique for programming the b ehavior of a GUI: Write\\nclasses that include event-handling methods. Create objec ts that belong to these classes and\\nregister them as listeners with the objects that will actual ly detect or generate the events. When\\nan event occurs, the listener is notiﬁed, and the code that yo u wrote in one of its event-handling\\nmethods is executed. At ﬁrst, this might seem like a very roun dabout and complicated way to\\nget things done, but as you gain experience with it, you will ﬁ nd that it is very ﬂexible and\\nthat it goes together very well with object oriented program ming.

T hey can do things on Web pages\\nthat can’t easily be done with other technologies. It is easy to distribute applets to users: The\\nuser just has to open a Web page, and the applet is there, with n o special installation required\\n(although the user must have an appropriate version of Java i nstalled on their computer). And\\nof course, applets are fun; now that the Web has become such a c ommon part of life, it’s nice\\nto be able to see your work running on a web page.\\nThe good news is that writing applets is not much diﬀerent fro m writing stand-alone appli-\\ncations. The structure of an applet is essentially the same a s the structure of the JFrame s that' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 246}\n",

      "--- Page 884 ---\n",
      "page_content='cations. The structure of an applet is essentially the same a s the structure of the JFrame s that\\nwere introduced in the previous section, and events are hand led in the same way in both types\\nof program. So, most of what you learn about applications app lies to applets, and vice versa .\\nOf course, one diﬀerence is that an applet is dependent on a We b page, so to use applets\\neﬀectively, you have to learn at least a little about creatin g Web pages. Web pages are written\\nusing a language called HTML (HyperText Markup Language). In Subsection 6.2.3, below,\\nyou’ll learn how to use HTML to create Web pages that display a pplets.\\n6.2.1 JApplet\\nTheJApplet class (in package javax.swing ) can be used as a basis for writing applets in the\\nsame way that JFrame is used for writing stand-alone applications.

Since an applet is not a stand-alone application, this area\\nmust appear on a Web page, or in some other environment that kn ows how to display an applet.\\nLike a JFrame , aJApplet contains a content pane (and can contain a menu bar). You can a dd\\ncontent to an applet either by adding content to its content p ane or by replacing the content\\npane with another component. In my examples, I will generall y create a JPanel and use it as a\\nreplacement for the applet’s content pane.\\nTo create an applet, you will write a subclass of JApplet . The JApplet class deﬁnes several\\ninstance methods that are unique to applets. These methods a re called by the applet’s environ-\\nment at certain points during the applet’s “life cycle.” In t heJApplet class itself, these methods\\ndo nothing; you can override these methods in a subclass.

That is, they\\nwill have to use (x,y) coordinates that are calculated based on the actual height a nd width of\\nthe component.\\n6.3.2 Colors\\nYou will probably want to use some color when you draw.

Often, you can avoid constructing\\nnew colors altogether, since the Color class deﬁnes several named constants representing com-\\nmon colors: Color.WHITE ,Color.BLACK ,Color.RED ,Color.GREEN ,Color.BLUE ,Color.CYAN ,\\nColor.MAGENTA ,Color.YELLOW ,Color.PINK ,Color.ORANGE ,Color.LIGHT GRAY,Color.GRAY ,\\nandColor.DARK GRAY.

In the HSB system, a color is speciﬁed by\\nthree numbers called the hue, thesaturation , and the brightness . The hue is the basic color,\\nranging from red through orange through all the other colors of the rainbow. The brightness is\\npretty much what it sounds like. A fully saturated color is a p ure color tone. Decreasing the\\nsaturation is like mixing white or gray paint into the pure co lor.

Graphics2D is a sub-class of Graphics , so all the methods from the\\nGraphics class are also available in a Graphics2D .\\nThepaintComponent() method of a JComponent gives you a graphics context of type\\nGraphics that you can use for drawing on the component.

When the pa nel’spaintComponent()\\nmethod is called, it chooses random colors, fonts, and locat ions for the messages. The informa-\\ntion about which colors, fonts, and locations are used is not stored anywhere. The next time\\npaintComponent() is called, it will make diﬀerent random choices and will draw a diﬀerent\\npicture. For this particular applet, the problem only reall y appears when the panel is partially\\ncovered and then uncovered (and even then the problem does no t show up in all environments).\\nIt is possible that only the part that was covered will be redr awn, and in the part that’s not\\nredrawn, the old picture will remain. The user might see part ial messages, cut oﬀ by the di-\\nviding line between the new picture and the old.

Unfortunately, to store\\nthe data for the picture in this applet, we would need to use ei ther arrays, which will not be\\ncovered until Chapter 7, or oﬀ-screen images, which will not be covered until Chapter 12. Other\\nexamples in this chapter will suﬀer from the same problem.\\nThe source for the panel class is shown below.

Instead, the program must be p repared to respond to various\\nkinds of events that can happen at unpredictable times and in an order that the program doesn’t\\ncontrol. The most basic kinds of events are generated by the m ouse and keyboard. The user\\ncan press any key on the keyboard, move the mouse, or press a bu tton on the mouse. The user\\ncan do any of these things at any time, and the computer has to r espond appropriately.' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 266}\n",

When an event occ urs, the system collects all the\\ninformation relevant to the event and constructs an object t o contain that information. Diﬀerent\\ntypes of events are represented by objects belonging to diﬀe rent classes. For example, when the\\nuser presses one of the buttons on a mouse, an object belongin g to a class called MouseEvent\\nis constructed. The object contains information such as the source of the event (that is, the\\ncomponent on which the user clicked), the (x,y) coordinates of the point in the component\\nwhere the click occurred, and which button on the mouse was pr essed. When the user presses a\\nkey on the keyboard, a KeyEvent is created. After the event object is constructed, it is pass ed\\nas a parameter to a designated subroutine.

It’s part of “the system.” If you write a GUI program in some\\nother language, you might have to provide a main routine that runs an event loop.\\nIn this section, we’ll look at handling mouse events in Java, and we’ll cover the framework\\nfor handling events in general. The next section will cover k eyboard-related events and timer\\nevents. Java also has other types of events, which are produc ed by GUI components. These\\nwill be introduced in Section 6.6.\\n6.4.1 Event Handling\\nFor an event to have any eﬀect, a program must detect the event and react to it. In order to\\ndetect an event, the program must “listen” for it. Listening for events is something that is done\\nby an object called an event listener . An event listener object must contain instance methods' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 267}\n",

      "--- Page 965 ---\n",

For example, if an object is to serve as a listener for\\nevents of type MouseEvent , then it must contain the following method (among several ot hers):\\npublic void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) { . . . }\\nThe body of the method deﬁnes how the object responds when it i s notiﬁed that a mouse button\\nhas been pressed. The parameter, evt, contains information about the event. This information\\ncan be used by the listener object to determine its response.\\nThe methods that are required in a mouse event listener are sp eciﬁed in an interface\\nnamed MouseListener . To be used as a listener for mouse events, an object must impl ement\\nthisMouseListener interface. Java interfaces were covered in Subsection 5.7.1.

This\\ninformation is available from the MouseEvent parameter to the event-handling method, which\\ncontains instance methods that return information about th e event. If evtis the parame-\\nter, then you can ﬁnd out the coordinates of the mouse cursor b y calling evt.getX() and\\nevt.getY() . These methods return integers which give the xandycoordinates where the\\nmouse cursor was positioned at the time when the event occurr ed. The coordinates are ex-\\npressed in the coordinate system of the component that gener ated the event, where the top left\\ncorner of the component is (0,0).\\nThe user can hold down certain modiﬁer keys while using the mouse. The possible mod-\\niﬁer keys include: the Shift key, the Control key, the ALT key (called the Option key on the\\nMacintosh), and the Meta key (called the Command or Apple key on the Macintosh).

Now, not every\\nmouse has a middle button and a right button, so Java handles t he information in a peculiar\\nway. It treats pressing the right button as equivalent to hol ding down the Meta key while\\npressing the left mouse button. That is, if the right button i s pressed, then the instance\\nmethodevt.isMetaDown() will return true(even if the Meta key is not pressed).

The net result is that the appearance of the panel chan ges when the panel gains or loses' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 285}\n",

      "page_content='focus. The net result is that the appearance of the panel chan ges when the panel gains or loses\\nfocus. The methods from the FocusListener interface are deﬁned simply as:\\npublic void focusGained(FocusEvent evt) {\\n// The panel now has the input focus.\\nrepaint(); // will redraw with a new message and a cyan border\\n}\\npublic void focusLost(FocusEvent evt) {\\n// The panel has now lost the input focus.\\nrepaint(); // will redraw with a new message and a gray border\\n}\\nThe other aspect of handling focus is to make sure that the panel gets the focus when the\\nuser clicks on it. To do this, the panel implements the MouseListener interface and listens for\\nmouse events on itself. It deﬁnes a mousePressed routine that asks that the input focus be\\ngiven to the panel:\\npublic void mousePressed(MouseEvent evt) {\\nrequestFocus();\\n}\\nThe other four methods of the mouseListener interface are deﬁned to be empty. Note that the' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 285}\n",

Note that the\\npanel implements three diﬀerent listener interfaces, KeyListener ,FocusListener , and MouseLis-\\ntener, and the constructor in the panel class registers itself to l isten for all three types of events\\nwith the statements:\\naddKeyListener(this);\\naddFocusListener(this);\\naddMouseListener(this);\\nThere are, of course, other ways to organize this example. It would be possible, for example, to\\nuse a nested class to deﬁne the listening object. Or anonymou s classes could be used to deﬁne\\nseparate listening objects for each type of event. In my next example, I will take the latter\\napproach.\\n6.5.4 State Machines\\nThe information stored in an object’s instance variables is said to represent the state of that\\nobject.

In computer\\nscience, there is the idea of a state machine , which is just something that has a state and\\ncan change state in response to events or inputs. The respons e of a state machine to an event\\nor input depends on what state it’s in. An object is a kind of st ate machine. Sometimes, this\\npoint of view can be very useful in designing classes.\\nThe state machine point of view can be especially useful in th e type of event-oriented\\nprogramming that is required by graphical user interfaces. When designing a GUI program,\\nyou can ask yourself: What information about state do I need t o keep track of? What events\\ncan change the state of the program?

If the user moves the mouse outside the push button before releasing the mouse\\nbutton, the button changes to its regular appearance.

The button changes appearance when it has the focus. If the button\\nhas the focus and the user presses the space bar, the button is triggered. This means that the\\nbutton must respond to keyboard and focus events as well.\\nFortunately, you don’t have to program anyof this, provided you use an object belonging\\nto the standard class javax.swing.JButton .

To use any component eﬀectively, ther e are several aspects of the\\ncorresponding class that you should be familiar with. For JButton , as an example, I list these\\naspects explicitely:\\n•Constructors : The JButton class has a constructor that takes a string as a parameter.\\nThis string becomes the text displayed on the button. For exa mple:stopGoButton =\\nnew JButton(\"Go\") . This creates a button object that will display the text, “Go ” (but' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 290}\n",

This event is sent to any listener that has been registered w ith the button as an\\nActionListener .\\n•Listeners : An object that wants to handle events generated by buttons m ust imple-\\nment the ActionListener interface.

INTRODUCTION TO GUI PROGRAMMING\\n•Registration of Listeners : In order to actually receive notiﬁcation of an event from a\\nbutton, an ActionListener must be registered with the button. This is done with the but-\\nton’saddActionListener() method. For example: stopGoButton.addActionListener(\\nbuttonHandler );\\n•Event methods : WhenactionPerformed(evt) is called by the button, the parameter,\\nevt, contains information about the event. This information ca n be retrieved by calling\\nmethods in the ActionEvent class. In particular, evt.getActionCommand() returns a\\nString giving the command associated with the button. By default, t his command is the\\ntext that is displayed on the button, but it is possible to set it to some other string. The\\nmethodevt.getSource() returns a reference to the Object that produced the event,\\nthat is, to the JButton that was pressed. The return value is of type Object , notJButton ,\\nbecause other types of components can also produce ActionEvent s.' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 291}\n",

ThesetEnabled() andsetText() methods of a button are particularly useful\\nfor giving the user information about what is going on in the p rogram. A disabled button is\\nbetter than a button that gives an obnoxious error message su ch as “Sorry, you can’t click on\\nme now!”\\n6.6.2 JLabel\\nJLabel is certainly the simplest type of component.

The border is drawn along the edges of the\\ncomponent, just inside its boundary. The layout manager of a JPanel or other container will\\ntake the space occupied by the border into account. The compo nents that are added to the\\ncontainer will be displayed in the area inside the border. I d on’t recommend using a border on\\naJPanel that is being used as a drawing surface.

It displays the string stored in the message variable. It draws each\\nof the cards in the hand. There is one little tricky bit: If a game is in progress, it dr aws an\\nextra face-down card, which is not in the hand, to represent t he next card in the deck. Drawing\\nthe cards requires some care and computation. I wrote a metho d, “void drawCard(Graphics\\ng, Card card, int x, int y) ”, which draws a card with its upper left corner at the point\\n(x,y) . ThepaintComponent() routine decides where to draw each card and calls this routin e\\nto do the drawing. You can check out all the details in the sour ce code, HighLowGUI.java .\\n∗ ∗ ∗\\nOne further note on the programming of this example: The sour ce code deﬁnes HighLowGUI\\nas a subclass of JPanel .

The class contains a main() routine so that it can be run as a stand-alone\\napplication; the main() routine simply opens a window that uses a panel of type HighLowGUI\\nas its content pane. In addition, I decided to write an applet version of the program as a\\nstatic nested class named Applet inside the HighLowGUI class. Since this is a nested class, its\\nfull name is HighLowGUI.Applet and the class ﬁle that is produced when the source code is\\ncompiled is named HighLowGUI$Applet.class . This class is used for the applet version of the\\nprogram in the on-line version of the book. The <applet>tag lists the class ﬁle for the applet\\nascode=\"HighLowGUI$Applet.class\" . This is admittedly an unusual way to organize the\\nprogram, and it is probably more natural to have the panel, ap plet, and stand-alone program\\ndeﬁned in separate classes.

The “Color”\\nmenu lets the user select the color that will be used when the u ser draws. The “Tools” menu\\naﬀects the behavior of the mouse. Using the default “Draw” to ol, the mouse leaves a trail of\\nsingle squares. Using the “Draw 3x3” tool, the mouse leaves a swath of colored squares that is\\nthree squares wide.

There are also “Erase” tools, which let t he user set squares back to their\\ndefault black color.\\nThe drawing area of the program is a panel that belongs to the MosaicPanel class, a subclass\\nofJPanel that is deﬁned in MosaicPanel.java .MosaicPanel is a highly reusable class for repre-\\nsenting mosaics of colored rectangles. It does not directly support drawing on the mosaic, but\\nit does support setting the color of each individual square. The MosaicDraw program installs a\\nmouse listener on the panel; the mouse listener responds to m ousePressed and mouseDragged\\nevents on the panel by setting the color of the square that con tains the mouse. This is a nice\\nexample of applying a listener to an object to do something th at was not programmed into the\\nobject itself.\\nMost of the programming for MosaicDraw can be found in MosaicDrawController.java .

You can change the text of the item by ca lling itssetText(String)\\nmethod, and you can enable it and disable it using the setEnabled(boolean) method. All this\\nworks in exactly the same way as for a JButton .\\nThe main diﬀerence between a menu item and a button, of course , is that a menu item\\nis meant to appear in a menu rather than in a panel. A menu in Jav a is represented by\\nthe class JMenu . AJMenu has a name, which is speciﬁed in the constructor, and it has an\\nadd(JMenuItem) method that can be used to add a JMenuItem to the menu. So, the “Tools”\\nmenu in the MosaicDraw program could be created as follows, w herelistener is a variable of\\ntypeActionListener :\\nJMenu toolsMenu = new JMenu(\"Tools\"); // Create a menu with n ame \"Tools\"\\nJMenuItem drawCommand = new JMenuItem(\"Draw\"); // Create a menu item.' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 313}\n",

A me nu bar is represented\\nby the class JMenuBar . A menu bar is just a container for menus. It does not have a nam e,\\nand its constructor does not have any parameters. It has an add(JMenu) method that can be\\nused to add menus to the menu bar. For example, the MosaicDraw program uses three menus,\\ncontrolMenu ,colorMenu , andtoolsMenu . We could create a menu bar and add the menus to\\nit with the statements:' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 313}\n",

We could create a menu bar and add the menus to\\nit with the statements:\\nJMenuBar menuBar = new JMenuBar();\\nmenuBar.add(controlMenu);\\nmenuBar.add(colorMenu);\\nmenuBar.add(toolsMenu);\\nThe ﬁnal step in using menus is to use the menu bar in a JApplet orJFrame . We have already\\nseen that an applet or frame has a “content pane.” The menu bar is another component of the\\napplet or frame, not contained inside the content pane. Both theJApplet and the JFrame\\nclasses include an instance method setMenuBar(JMenuBar) that can be used to set the menu\\nbar. (There can only be one, so this is a “set” method rather th an an “add” method.) In the\\nMosaicDraw program, the menu bar is created by a MosaicDrawController object and can be\\nobtained by calling that object’s getMenuBar() method.

Furthermore, all the items in an array must be of the same typ e. The\\ndeﬁnition of an array is: a numbered sequence of items, which are all of the same type.

Two fundamental array processing techniques—searc hing and sorting—will be covered\\nin Section 7.4. This section introduces some of the basic ide as of array processing in general.\\n7.2.1 Arrays and for Loops\\nIn many cases, processing an array means applying the same op eration to each item in the\\narray. This is commonly done with a forloop. A loop for processing all the elements of an\\narrayAhas the form:\\n// do any necessary initialization\\nfor (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {\\n. . . // process A[i]\\n}\\nSuppose, for example, that Ais an array of type double[ ] . Suppose that the goal is to add\\nup all the numbers in the array.

It’s\\nimportant to use “ <” here, not “ <=”, since “ <=” would give an array index out of bounds error.\\nThere is no element at position A.length inA.\\nEventually, you should just about be able to write loops simi lar to this one in your sleep.\\nI will give a few more simple examples. Here is a loop that will count the number of items in\\nthe array Awhich are less than zero:\\nint count; // For counting the items.\\ncount = 0; // Start with 0 items counted.\\nfor (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {\\nif (A[i] < 0.0) // if this item is less than zero...\\ncount++; // ...then count it\\n}' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 334}\n",

Here is a variation on the same t heme. Suppose you want to count\\nthe number of times that an item in the array Ais equal to the item that follows it. The item\\nthat follows A[i]in the array is A[i+1] , so the test in this case is “ if (A[i] == A[i+1]) ”.\\nBut there is a catch: This test cannot be applied when A[i]is the last item in the array, since\\nthen there is no such item as A[i+1] . The result of trying to apply the test in this case would\\nbe an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException . This just means that we have to stop one item short\\nof the ﬁnal item:\\nint count = 0;\\nfor (int i = 0; i < A.length - 1 ; i++) {\\nif (A[i] == A[i+1])\\ncount++;\\n}' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 334}\n",

The strategy is to go through\\nthe array, keeping track of the largest number found so far. W e’ll store the largest number\\nfound so far in a variable called max. As we look through the array, whenever we ﬁnd a number\\nlarger than the current value of max, we change the value of maxto that larger value. After the\\nwhole array has been processed, maxis the largest item in the array overall. The only question\\nis, what should the original value of maxbe? One possibility is to start with maxequal toA[0],\\nand then to look through the rest of the array, starting from A[1], for larger items:\\ndouble max = A[0];\\nfor (int i = 1 ; i < A.length; i++) {\\nif (A[i] > max)\\nmax = A[i];\\n}\\n// at this point, max is the largest item in A' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 334}\n",

In\\nthat case, A[0]doesn’t exist, and the reference to A[0]in the ﬁrst line gives an array index out\\nof bounds error. However, zero-length arrays are normally s omething that you want to avoid\\nin real problems. Anyway, what would it mean to ask for the lar gest item in an array that\\ncontains no items at all?)\\nAs a ﬁnal example of basic array operations, consider the pro blem of copying an array.

All it does is de clare a new array variable and\\nmake it refer to the same object to which Arefers. (So that, for example, a change to A[i]will\\nautomatically change B[i]as well.)

The subroutine, System.arraycopy() , is a static member\\nsubroutine in the standard System class.

The for-each loop is meant speciﬁcally fo r processing all the values in a data\\nstructure. When used to process an array, a for-each loop can be used to perform the same\\noperation on each value that is stored in the array. If anArray is an array of type BaseType[ ] ,\\nthen a for-each loop for anArray has the form:\\nfor ( BaseType item : anArray ) {\\n.\\n. // process the item\\n.\\n}\\nIn this loop, itemis the loop control variable. It is being declared as a variab le of type BaseType ,\\nwhere BaseType is the base type of the array. (In a for-each loop, the loop con trol variable must\\nbe declared in the loop.) When this loop is executed, each val ue from the array is assigned' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 335}\n",

For example, th ere is no simple way to use it\\nto process the items in just a part of an array. However, it doe s make it a little easier to process\\nall the values in an array, since it eliminates any need to use array indices.\\nIt’s important to note that a for-each loop processes the values in the array, not the\\nelements (where an element means the actual memory location that is pa rt of the array).

DOES NOT MODIFY THE ARRAY!\\nitem = 17;\\n}\\nThe assignment statement item = 17 assigns the value 17 to the loop control variable, item.\\nHowever, this has nothing to do with the array. When the body o f the loop is executed, the\\nvalue from one of the elements of the array is copied into item. The statement item = 17\\nreplaces that copied value but has no eﬀect on the array eleme nt from which it was copied; the\\nvalue in the array is not changed.\\n7.2.3 Array Types in Subroutines\\nAny array type, such as double[ ] , is a full-ﬂedged Java type, so it can be used in all the ways\\nthat any other Java type can be used.

You’ve seen this used\\nsince all the way back in Section 2.1, but I haven’t really bee n able to explain it until now.\\nThe parameter to the main() routine is an array of String s. When the system calls the main()\\nroutine, the strings in this array are the command-line arguments from the command that\\nwas used to run the program. When using a command-line interf ace, the user types a command\\nto tell the system to execute a program. The user can include e xtra input in this command,\\nbeyond the name of the program. This extra input becomes the c ommand-line arguments.

That is, the elements\\nof the array were processed one after the other in the sequenc e in which they occur in the array.\\nBut one of the big advantages of arrays is that they allow random access . That is, every\\nelement of the array is equally accessible at any given time.\\nAs an example, let’s look at a well-known problem called the b irthday problem: Suppose\\nthat there are Npeople in a room.

Before version 5.0,\\nevery method in Java had a ﬁxed arity. (The arity of a subroutine is deﬁned as the number of\\nparameters in a call to the method.) In a ﬁxed arity method, th e number of parameters must\\nbe the same in every call to the method. Java 5.0 introduced variable arity methods .

The ﬁrst paramete r ofSystem.out.printf must be\\naString , but it can have any number of additional parameters, of any t ypes.\\nCalling a variable arity method is no diﬀerent from calling a ny other sort of method, but\\nwriting one requires some new syntax. As an example, conside r a method that can compute\\nthe average of any number of values of type double . The deﬁnition of such a method could\\nbegin with:\\npublic static double average( double... numbers ) {\\nHere, the ...after the type name, double , indicates that any number of values of type\\ndouble can be provided when the subroutine is called, so that for exa mpleaverage(1,2,3) ,\\naverage(3.14,2.17) ,average(0.375) , and even average() are all legal calls to this method.' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 343}\n",

The integers will, as usual,\\nbe automatically converted to real numbers.\\nWhen the method is called, the values of all the actual parame ters that correspond to the\\nvariable arity parameter are placed into an array, and it is t his array that is actually passed to\\nthe method. That is, in the body of a method, a variable arity p arameter of type Tactually\\nlooks like an ordinary parameter of type T[ ]. The length of the array tells you how many\\nactual parameters were provided in the method call. In the average example, the body of the\\nmethod would see an array named numbers of type double[ ] . The number of actual parameters\\nin the method call would be numbers.length , and the values of the actual parameters would\\nbenumbers[0] ,numbers[1] , and so on.

For example, if salesData is a variable of type double[ ] , then it would be legal to call\\naverage(salesData) , and this would compute the average of all the numbers in the a rray.\\nAs another example, consider a method that can draw a polygon through any number of\\npoints.

In many cases, however, the number of data\\nitems that are actually stored in the array varies with time. Consider the following examples:\\nAn array that stores the lines of text in a word-processing pr ogram. An array that holds the list\\nof computers that are currently downloading a page from a Web site. An array that contains\\nthe shapes that have been added to the screen by the user of a dr awing program. Clearly, we\\nneed some way to deal with cases where the number of data items in an array is not ﬁxed.\\n7.3.1 Partially Full Arrays\\nConsider an application where the number of items that we wan t to store in an array changes' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 344}\n",

It is the\\nnumber of items that have been entered into the array. But it i s also the index of the next\\navailable spot in the array. For example, if 4 numbers have be en stored in the array, they occupy\\nlocations number 0, 1, 2, and 3. The next available spot is loc ation 4. When the time comes to\\nprint out the numbers in the array, the last occupied spot in t he array is location numCount -\\n1, so theforloop prints out values starting from location numCount - 1 and going down to 0.\\nLet’s look at another, more realistic example.

But there is no upper limit on the p ositions that can be used (except\\nthose imposed by the size of the computer’s memory).

But if the elements in the array are k nown to be in increasing or decreas-\\ning order, then a much faster search algorithm can be used.

Although\\nthe implementation is not trivial, the basic idea is simple: If you are searching for an item in\\na sorted list, then it is possible to eliminate half of the ite ms in the list by inspecting a single\\nitem. For example, suppose that you are looking for the numbe r 42 in a sorted array of 1000\\nintegers. Let’s assume that the array is sorted into increas ing order. Suppose you check item\\nnumber 500 in the array, and ﬁnd that the item is 93. Since 42 is less than 93, and since the\\nelements in the array are in increasing order, we can conclud e that if 42 occurs in the array\\nat all, then it must occur somewhere before location 500.

If the number a t that location is, say, -21,\\nthen you can eliminate locations before 250 and limit furthe r search to locations between 251\\nand 499. The next test will limit the search to about 125 locat ions, and the one after that to\\nabout 62. After just 10 steps, there is only one location left . This is a whole lot better than\\nlooking through every element in the array. If there were a mi llion items, it would still take\\nonly 20 steps for binary search to search the array!

It could, for example, be passed to a subroutine that asks fo r a parameter of type\\nint[ ].\\nThe notation A[1]refers to one of the rows of the array A. SinceA[1]is itself an array of\\nints, you can use another subscript to refer to one of the position s in that row. For example,\\nA[1][3] refers to item number 3 in row number 1. Keep in mind, of course , that both rows\\nand columns are numbered starting from zero. So, in the above example, A[1][3] is 5.

INTRODUCTION TO CORRECTNESS AND ROBUSTNESS 377\\n8.1.3 Problems Remain in Java\\nThere is one area where the designers of Java chose not to dete ct errors automatically: numerical\\ncomputations. In Java, a value of type intis represented as a 32-bit binary number. With 32\\nbits, it’s possible to represent a little over four billion d iﬀerent values. The values of type int\\nrange from -2147483648 to 2147483647. What happens when the result of a computation lies\\noutside this range? For example, what is 2147483647 + 1 ? And what is 2000000000 * 2 ? The\\nmathematically correct result in each case cannot be repres ented as a value of type int. These\\nare examples of integer overﬂow . In most cases, integer overﬂow should be considered an\\nerror. However, Java does not automatically detect such err ors. For example, it will compute\\nthe value of 2147483647 + 1 to be the negative number, -2147483648 . (What happens is' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 392}\n",

      "page_content='the value of 2147483647 + 1 to be the negative number, -2147483648 . (What happens is\\nthat any extra bits beyond the 32-nd bit in the correct answer are discarded. Values greater\\nthan 2147483647 will “wrap around” to negative values. Math ematically speaking, the result\\nis always “correct modulo 232”.)\\nFor example, consider the 3N+1 program, which was discussed in Subsection 3.2.2. Starting\\nfrom a positive integer N, the program computes a certain sequence of integers:\\nwhile ( N != 1 ) {\\nif ( N % 2 == 0 ) // If N is even...\\nN = N / 2;\\nelse\\nN = 3 * N + 1;\\nSystem.out.println(N);\\n}\\nBut there is a problem here: If Nis too large, then the value of 3*N+1 will not be mathematically\\ncorrect because of integer overﬂow. The problem arises when ever3*N+1 > 2147483647 , that is\\nwhenN > 2147483646/3 . For a completely correct program, we should check for this p ossibility\\nbefore computing 3*N+1 :\\nwhile ( N != 1 ) {\\nif ( N % 2 == 0 ) // If N is even...\\nN = N / 2;\\nelse {\\nif (N > 2147483646/3) {' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 392}\n",

The problem is that it just can’t be correctly impleme nted using 32-bit integers. Many\\nprograms ignore this type of problem. But integer overﬂow er rors have been responsible for their\\nshare of serious computer failures, and a completely robust program should take the possibility\\nof integer overﬂow into account. (The infamous “Y2K” bug was , in fact, just this sort of error.)\\nFor numbers of type double , there are even more problems.

Instead, they\\nare represented by special values that have no real numerica l equivalent. The special values\\nDouble.POSITIVE INFINITY andDouble.NEGATIVE INFINITY represent numbers outside the\\nrange of legal values.

These are the\\nmain topics of the rest of this chapter.\\n8.2 Writing Correct Programs\\nCorrect programs don’t just happen. It takes planning and attention to detail to avo id\\nerrors in programs. There are some techniques that programm ers can use to increase the\\nlikelihood that their programs are correct.\\n8.2.1 Provably Correct Programs\\nIn some cases, it is possible to prove that a program is correct. That is, it is possible to\\ndemonstrate mathematically that the sequence of computati ons represented by the program\\nwill always produce the correct result. Rigorous proof is di ﬃcult enough that in practice it can\\nonly be applied to fairly small programs. Furthermore, it de pends on the fact that the “correct\\nresult” has been speciﬁed correctly and completely. As I’ve already pointed out, a program' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 393}\n",

      "page_content='result” has been speciﬁed correctly and completely. As I’ve already pointed out, a program\\nthat correctly meets its speciﬁcation is not useful if its sp eciﬁcation was wrong. Nevertheless,\\neven in everyday programming, we can apply some of the ideas a nd techniques that are used\\nin proving that programs are correct.\\nThe fundamental ideas are process andstate. A state consists of all the information\\nrelevant to the execution of a program at a given moment durin g its execution. The state\\nincludes, for example, the values of all the variables in the program, the output that has been\\nproduced, any input that is waiting to be read, and a record of the position in the program\\nwhere the computer is working. A process is the sequence of st ates that the computer goes\\nthrough as it executes the program. From this point of view, t he meaning of a statement in a\\nprogram can be expressed in terms of the eﬀect that the execut ion of that statement has on the' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 393}\n",

For example, consider the doloop:\\ndo {\\nTextIO.put(\"Enter a positive integer: \");\\nN = TextIO.getlnInt();\\n} while (N <= 0);\\nAfter this loop ends, we can be absolutely sure that the value of the variable Nis greater than\\nzero. The loop cannot end until this condition is satisﬁed. T his fact is part of the meaning of\\nthewhile loop. More generally, if a while loop uses the test “ while ( /angbracketleftcondition /angbracketright)”, then\\nafter the loop ends, we can be sure that the /angbracketleftcondition /angbracketrightis false. We can then use this fact to\\ndraw further deductions about what happens as the execution of the program continues. (With' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 394}\n",

(With\\na loop, by the way, we also have to worry about the question of w hether the loop will ever end.\\nThis is something that has to be veriﬁed separately.)\\nA fact that can be proven to be true after a given program segme nt has been executed\\nis called a postcondition of that program segment. Postconditions are known facts upo n\\nwhich we can build further deductions about the behavior of t he program. A postcondition\\nof a program as a whole is simply a fact that can be proven to be t rue after the program has\\nﬁnished executing.

The\\nmethod is referred to as exception handling . The word “exception” is meant to be more\\ngeneral than “error.” It includes any circumstance that ari ses as the program is executed which\\nis meant to be treated as an exception to the normal ﬂow of cont rol of the program.

When this happens, the normal ﬂow of the program is thrown oﬀ -track, and the\\nprogram is in danger of crashing. However, the crash can be av oided if the exception is caught\\nand handled in some way. An exception can be thrown in one part of a program and caught\\nin a diﬀerent part. An exception that is not caught will gener ally cause the program to crash.\\n(More exactly, the thread that throws the exception will cra sh. In a multithreaded program,\\nit is possible for other threads to continue even after one cr ashes. We will cover threads in\\nSection 8.5.

It doesn’t mean that\\nthe Java interpreter will crash. In eﬀect, the interpreter c atches any exceptions that are not\\ncaught by the program. The interpreter responds by terminat ing the program. In many other\\nprogramming languages, a crashed program will sometimes cr ash the entire system and freeze\\nthe computer until it is restarted. With Java, such system cr ashes should be impossible—which\\nmeans that when they happen, you have the satisfaction of bla ming the system rather than\\nyour own program.\\nExceptions were introduced in Section 3.7, along with the try..catch statement, which is\\nused to catch and handle exceptions. However, that section d id not cover the complete syntax' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 401}\n",

This information al ways includes the subroutine\\ncall stack , which is a list of the subroutines that were being executed w hen the exception was\\nthrown. (Since one subroutine can call another, several sub routines can be active at the same\\ntime.) Typically, an exception object also includes an erro r message describing what happened\\nto cause the exception, and it can contain other data as well.

In addition, a programmer can create new exception classes\\nto represent new types of exception.\\nMost of the subclasses of the class Error represent serious errors within the Java virtual\\nmachine that should ordinarily cause program termination b ecause there is no reasonable way\\nto handle them. In general, you should not try to catch and han dle such errors. An example is\\naClassFormatError , which occurs when the Java virtual machine ﬁnds some kind of illegal data\\nin a ﬁle that is supposed to contain a compiled Java class. If t hat class was being loaded as\\npart of the program, then there is really no way for the progra m to proceed.\\nOn the other hand, subclasses of the class Exception represent exceptions that are meant\\nto be caught.

To use the full power of these multip rocessing computers, a programmer\\nmust do parallel programming , which means writing a program as a set of several tasks that\\ncan be executed simultaneously. Even on a single-processor computer, parallel programming\\ntechniques can be useful, since some problems can be tackled most naturally by breaking the\\nsolution into a set of simultaneous tasks that cooperate to s olve the problem.\\nIn Java, a single task is called a thread . The term “thread” refers to a “thread of control” or\\n“thread of execution,” meaning a sequence of instructions t hat are executed one after another—\\nthe thread extends through time, connecting each instructi on to the next.

In the rest of this section, we’ll look at a\\nvariety of examples, and we’ll see other examples in the rest of the book.\\n9.1.1 Recursive Binary Search\\nLet’s start with an example that you’ve seen before: the bina ry search algorithm from Subsec-\\ntion 7.4.1. Binary search is used to ﬁnd a speciﬁed value in a s orted list of items (or, if it does' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 443}\n",

      "page_content='tion 7.4.1. Binary search is used to ﬁnd a speciﬁed value in a s orted list of items (or, if it does\\nnot occur in the list, to determine that fact). The idea is to t est the element in the middle of\\nthe list. If that element is equal to the speciﬁed value, you a re done. If the speciﬁed value is\\nless than the middle element of the list, then you should sear ch for the value in the ﬁrst half of\\nthe list. Otherwise, you should search for the value in the se cond half of the list. The method\\nused to search for the value in the ﬁrst or second half of the li st is binary search. That is, you\\nlook at the middle element in the half of the list that is still under consideration, and either\\nyou’ve found the value you are looking for, or you have to appl y binary search to one half of the\\nremaining elements. And so on! This is a recursive descripti on, and we can write a recursive\\nsubroutine to implement it.\\nBefore we can do that, though, there are two considerations t hat we need to take into' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 443}\n",

Each of these illustrates an important general fac t about recursive subroutines. First\\nof all, the binary search algorithm begins by looking at the “ middle element of the list.” But\\nwhat if the list is empty? If there are no elements in the list, then it is impossible to look\\nat the middle element. In the terminology of Subsection 8.2. 1, having a non-empty list is a\\n“precondition” for looking at the middle element, and this i s a clue that we have to modify\\nthe algorithm to take this precondition into account. What s hould we do if we ﬁnd ourselves\\nsearching for a speciﬁed value in an empty list? The answer is easy: If the list is empty, we can\\nbe sure that the value does not occur in the list, so we can give the answer without any further\\nwork. An empty list is a base case for the binary search algorithm. A base case for a recursive' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 443}\n",

      "page_content='work. An empty list is a base case for the binary search algorithm. A base case for a recursive\\nalgorithm is a case that is handled directly, rather than by a pplying the algorithm recursively.\\nThe binary search algorithm actually has another type of bas e case: If we ﬁnd the element we\\nare looking for in the middle of the list, we are done. There is no need for further recursion.\\nThe second consideration has to do with the parameters to the subroutine. The problem is\\nphrased in terms of searching for a value in a list. In the orig inal, non-recursive binary search\\nsubroutine, the list was given as an array. However, in the re cursive approach, we have to\\nable to apply the subroutine recursively to just a partof the original list. Where the original\\nsubroutine was designed to search an entire array, the recur sive subroutine must be able to\\nsearch part of an array.

This is a standard example known as “The T owers of Hanoi.” The problem\\ninvolves a stack of various-sized disks, piled up on a base in order of decreasing size.

The situation after a number o f moves have been made is shown\\nin the bottom half of the picture. These pictures are from the applet at the end of Section 9.5,\\nwhich displays an animation of the step-by-step solution of the problem.\\nThe problem is to move ten disks from Stack 0 to Stack 1, subjec t to certain rules. Stack\\n2 can be used as a spare location. Can we reduce this to smaller problems of the same type,\\npossibly generalizing the problem a bit to make this possibl e?

The “-” operator in this expression applies\\nto the two operands that precede it, namely “ 15” and “12”. The “*” operator applies to the\\ntwo operands that precede it, namely “ 15 12 - ” and “17”. And the “ +” operator applies to\\n“2” and “15 12 - 17 * ”.

Then the 12is added to the stack. Now, we come to the operator, “ -”. This\\noperation applies to the two operands that preceded it in the expression. We have saved those\\ntwo operands on the stack. So, to process the “ -” operator, we pop two numbers from the\\nstack,12and15, and compute 15 - 12 to get the answer 3.

A binary tree can be used to store\\nan ordered list of strings, or other items, in a way that makes both searching and insertion\\neﬃcient. A binary tree used in this way is called a binary sort tree.\\nA binary sort tree is a binary tree with the following propert y: For every node in the tree,\\nthe item in that node is greater than every item in the left sub tree of that node, and it is less\\nthan or equal to all the items in the right subtree of that node .

It is still used today,\\nalthough its use is not very common. It has not achieved anyth ing like the popularity of Java\\nor C++, but it is the source of many ideas used in these languag es. In Smalltalk, essentially\\nall programming is generic, because of two basic properties of the language.\\nFirst of all, variables in Smalltalk are typeless. A data val ue has a type, such as integer or\\nstring, but variables do not have types. Any variable can hol d data of any type. Parameters\\nare also typeless, so a subroutine can be applied to paramete r values of any type. Similarly,\\na data structure can hold data values of any type. For example , once you’ve deﬁned a binary\\ntree data structure in SmallTalk, you can use it for binary tr ees of integers or strings or dates' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 501}\n",

There is simply no need to write new c ode for each data type.\\nSecondly, all data values are objects, and all operations on objects are deﬁned by methods\\nin a class. This is true even for types that are “primitive” in Java, such as integers. When the\\n“+” operator is used to add two integers, the operation is perfo rmed by calling a method in the\\ninteger class. When you deﬁne a new class, you can deﬁne a “ +” operator, and you will then\\nbe able to add objects belonging to that class by saying “ a + b ” just as if you were adding\\nnumbers. Now, suppose that you write a subroutine that uses t he “+” operator to add up the\\nitems in a list. The subroutine can be applied to a list of inte gers, but it can also be applied,\\nautomatically, to any other data type for which “ +” is deﬁned.

This is real generic pro gramming. This might sound pretty\\ngood, and you might be asking yourself why all programming la nguages don’t work this way.\\nThis type of freedom makes it easier to write programs, but un fortunately it makes it harder\\nto write programs that are correct and robust (see Chapter 8) .

Fortunately, it’s possible to specify a diﬀerent method to be used for comparing the\\nkeys of a map. This is a typical use for a Comparator .\\nRecall that an object that implements the interface Comparator <T>deﬁnes a method for\\ncomparing two objects of type T:\\npublic int compare( T obj1, T obj2 )' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 531}\n",

But in a graphical\\nuser interface, the user expects to be able to select ﬁles usi ng aﬁle dialog box , which is a\\nwindow that a program can open when it wants the user to select a ﬁle for input or output.\\nSwing includes a platform-independent technique for using ﬁle dialog boxes in the form of a\\nclass called JFileChooser .

The parent is speciﬁed as a parameter to the showOpenDialog orshowSaveDialog\\nmethods. The parent is a GUI component, and can often be speci ﬁed as “this” in prac-\\ntice, since ﬁle dialogs are often used in instance methods of GUI component classes.

Copying a ﬁle is a pretty common operation, and every ope rating system already has a\\ncommand for doing it. However, it is still instructive to loo k at a Java program that does the\\nsame thing. Many ﬁle operations are similar to copying a ﬁle, except that the data from the\\ninput ﬁle is processed in some way before it is written to the o utput ﬁle. All such operations\\ncan be done by programs with the same general form.\\nSince the program should be able to copy any ﬁle, we can’t assu me that the data in the\\nﬁle is in human-readable form. So, we have to use InputStream andOutputStream to operate\\non the ﬁle rather than Reader andWriter . The program simply copies all the data from the\\nInputStream to the OutputStream , one byte at a time. If source is the variable that refers to' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 570}\n",
      "\n",
      "--- Page 2036 ---\n",
      "page_content='InputStream to the OutputStream , one byte at a time. If source is the variable that refers to\\ntheInputStream , then the function source.read() can be used to read one byte. This function\\nreturns the value -1 when all the bytes in the input ﬁle have be en read. Similarly, if copyrefers\\nto the OutputStream , thencopy.write(b) writes one byte to the output ﬁle. So, the heart of\\nthe program is a simple while loop. As usual, the I/O operations can throw exceptions, so t his\\nmust be done in a try..catch statement:\\nwhile(true) {\\nint data = source.read();\\nif (data < 0)\\nbreak;\\ncopy.write(data);\\n}\\nThe ﬁle-copy command in an operating system such as UNIX uses command line argu-\\nments to specify the names of the ﬁles. For example, the user m ight say “ copy original.dat\\nbackup.dat ” to copy an existing ﬁle, original.dat , to a ﬁle named backup.dat . Command-\\nline arguments can also be used in Java programs.

      "page_content='line arguments can also be used in Java programs. The command line arguments are stored in\\nthe array of strings, args, which is a parameter to the main() routine. The program can retrieve\\nthe command-line arguments from this array. (See Subsectio n 7.2.3.) For example, if the pro-\\ngram is named CopyFile and if the user runs the program with the command “ java CopyFile\\nwork.dat oldwork.dat ”, then in the program, args[0] will be the string \"work.dat\" and\\nargs[1] will be the string \"oldwork.dat\" . The value of args.length tells the program how\\nmany command-line arguments were speciﬁed by the user.\\nMyCopyFile program gets the names of the ﬁles from the command-line argu ments. It\\nprints an error message and exits if the ﬁle names are not spec iﬁed. To add a little interest,\\nthere are two ways to use the program. The command line can sim ply specify the two ﬁle names.\\nIn that case, if the output ﬁle already exists, the program wi ll print an error message and end.' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 570}\n",

Any changes that are made should be pre served after the program\\nends.\\nThe sample program PhoneDirectoryFileDemo.java is a very simple implementation of this\\nidea. It is meant only as an example of ﬁle use; the phone book t hat it implements is a “toy”\\nversion that is not meant to taken seriously. This program st ores the phone book data in a ﬁle\\nnamed “.phonebookdemo” in the user’s home directory.

In\\nthat program, the user could use the mouse to draw simple sket ches. Now, we will add ﬁle\\ninput/output capabilities to that program.

E very resource has an\\naddress, which identiﬁes it uniquely and contains enough in formation for a Web browser to ﬁnd\\nthe resource on the network and retrieve it. The address is ca lled a “url” or “universal resource\\nlocator.”\\nAn object belonging to the URLclass represents such an address. Once you have a URL\\nobject, you can use it to open a URLConnection to the resource at that address. A url is\\nordinarily speciﬁed as a string, such as “ http://math.hws.edu/eck/index.html ”. There are\\nalsorelative url’s . A relative url speciﬁes the location of a resource relative to the location of\\nanother url, which is called the baseorcontext for the relative url. For example, if the context' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 584}\n",

For example, if the context\\nis given by the url http://math.hws.edu/eck/ , then the incomplete, relative url “ index.html ”\\nwould really refer to http://math.hws.edu/eck/index.html .\\nAn object of the class URLis not simply a string, but it can be constructed from a string\\nrepresentation of a url. A URLobject can also be constructed from another URLobject, repre-\\nsenting a context, and a string that speciﬁes a url relative t o that context. These constructors\\nhave prototypes\\npublic URL(String urlName) throws MalformedURLException\\nand\\npublic URL(URL context, String relativeName) throws Malfo rmedURLException\\nNote that these constructors will throw an exception of type MalformedURLException if the\\nspeciﬁed strings don’t represent legal url’s.

That is, you must call the\\nconstructor inside a try..catch statement that handles the exception or in a subroutine that\\nis declared to throw the exception.\\nThe second constructor is especially convenient when writi ng applets. In an applet, two\\nmethods are available that provide useful URL contexts. The methodgetDocumentBase() ,\\ndeﬁned in the Applet andJApplet classes, returns an object of type URL. This URLrepresents\\nthe location from which the HTML page that contains the apple t was downloaded. This allows\\nthe applet to go back and retrieve other ﬁles that are stored i n the same location as that\\ndocument. For example,\\nURL url = new URL(getDocumentBase(), \"data.txt\");\\nconstructs a URLthat refers to a ﬁle named data.txt on the same computer and in the same\\ndirectory as the source ﬁle for the web page on which the apple t is running.

This method returns a URLConnection . The URLConnection object can, in turn,\\nbe used to create an InputStream for reading data from the resource represented by the URL.\\nThis is done by calling its getInputStream() method.

Fro m the point of view of a program\\non one end of a network connection, messages can arrive from t he other side of the connection at\\nany time; the arrival of a message is an event that is not under the control of the program that\\nis receiving the message.

W hile it is waiting for the message,\\nwe say that the process is blocked .\\nPerhaps an event-oriented networking API would be a good app roach to dealing with the\\nasynchronous nature of network communication, but that is n ot the approach that is taken\\nin Java (or, typically, in other languages). Instead, a seri ous network program in Java uses\\nthreads . Threads were introduced in Section 8.5. A thread is a separa te computational\\nprocess that can run in parallel with other threads. When a pr ogram uses threads to do\\nnetwork communication, it is possible that some threads wil l be blocked, waiting for incoming\\nmessages, but other threads will still be able to continue pe rforming useful work.\\n11.5.1 A Threaded GUI Chat Program.\\nThe command-line chat programs, CLChatClient.java andCLChatServer.java , from the previ-' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 597}\n",

The basic ides for a GUI chat program is to cre ate a thread whose job is to read\\nmessages that arrive from the other side of the connection.

There are at least two big problem s. First of all, it is not\\nscalable . A network program is scalable if it will work well for a large number of simultaneous\\nusers.BuddyChat would have problems with a large number of users because it us es so many\\nthreads (two for each user). It takes a certain amount of proc essing for a computer to switch its\\nattention from one thread to another. On a very busy server, t he constant switching between\\nthreads would soon start to degrade the performance. One sol ution to this is to use a more\\nadvanced network API.

In this section, we’ll take a brief look at one type of ch aracter-based data representation\\nthat has become increasingly common.\\nXML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a syntax for creating data r epresentation languages.\\nThere are two aspects or levels of XML.

This is done by associating a DTD (Document Type Deﬁnition)\\nwith an XML document. A DTD is essentially a list of things tha t are allowed to appear in the\\nXML document. A well-formed XML document that has an associa ted DTD and that follows\\nthe rules of the DTD is said to be a valid XML document. The idea is that XML is a general\\nformat for data representation, and a DTD speciﬁes how to use XML to represent a particular\\nkind of data. (There is also an alternative to DTDs, known as XML schemas , for deﬁning\\nvalid XLM documents, but let’s ignore them here.)\\nThere is nothing magical about XML. It’s certainly not perfe ct. It’s a very verbose language,\\nand some people think it’s ugly. On the other hand it’s very ﬂe xible; it can be used to represent\\nalmost any type of data.

To r econstruct the data structure\\nrepresented by the XML Document, it is necessary to parse the document and extract the data\\nfrom it. Fortunately, Java has a standard API for parsing and processing XML Documents.\\n(Actually, it has two, but we will only look at one of them.)\\nA well-formed XML document has a certain structure, consist ing of elements containing\\nattributes, nested elements, and textual content. It’s pos sible to build a data structure in the\\ncomputer’s memory that corresponds to the structure and con tent of the document. Of course,\\nthere are many ways to do this, but there is one common standar d representation known as\\ntheDocument Object Model , or DOM. The DOM speciﬁes how to build data structures\\nto represent XML documents, and it speciﬁes some standard me thods for accessing the data' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 616}\n",

The data structure is a kind of tree whose s tructure mirrors the structure\\nof the document. The tree is constructed from nodes of various types. There are nodes to\\nrepresent elements, attributes, and text. (The tree can als o contain several other types of node,\\nrepresenting aspects of XML that we can ignore here.) Attrib utes and text can be processed\\nwithout directly manipulating the corresponding nodes, so we will be concerned almost entirely\\nwith element nodes.\\nThe sample program XMLDemo.java lets you experiment with XML and the DOM. It has a\\ntext area where you can enter an XML document. Initially, the input area contains the sample\\nXML document from this section.

(The program uses a few techniques that I won’t discuss\\nhere.)\\nIn Java, the DOM representation of an XML document ﬁle can be c reated with just two\\nstatements.

It is possible that t he complete image is not available\\nwhen this method is called; this can happen, for example, if t he image has to be read from\\na ﬁle. In that case, g.drawImage() merely initiates the drawing of the image and returns\\nimmediately. Pieces of the image are drawn later, asynchron ously, as they become available.\\nThe question is, howdo they get drawn? That’s where the fourth parameter to the drawImage\\nmethod comes in.

When d rawing an image that you\\nhave created in the computer’s memory, or one that you are sur e has already been completely\\nloaded, you can set the ImageObserver parameter to null.\\nThere are a few useful variations of the drawImage() method.

T his is done with the command\\ng.drawImage(img, x, y, width, height, imageObserver);\\nThe parameters width andheight give the size of the rectangle in which the image is displayed .\\nAnother version makes it possible to draw just part of the ima ge.

A checkbox has two states, selected an d not selected,\\nand the user can change the state by clicking on the check box. The state of a checkbox can\\nalso be set programmatically by calling its setSelected() method, and the current value of\\nthe state can be checked using the isSelected() method.\\nClosely related to checkboxes are radio buttons . Like a checkbox, a radio button can be\\neither selected or not. However, radio buttons are expected occur in groups, and at most one\\nradio button in a group can be selected at any given time. In Ja va, a radio button is represented' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 654}\n",

When used in isolation, a JRadioButton acts just like a\\nJCheckBox , and it has the same methods and events. Ordinarily, however , aJRadioButton\\nis used in a group. A group of radio buttons is represented by a n object belonging to the\\nclass ButtonGroup . AButtonGroup isnota component and does not itself have a visible\\nrepresentation on the screen. A ButtonGroup works behind the scenes to organize a group of\\nradio buttons, to ensure that at most one button in the group c an be selected at any given\\ntime.\\nTo use a group of radio buttons, you must create a JRadioButton object for each button\\nin the group, and you must create one object of type ButtonGroup to organize the individual\\nbuttons into a group.

If you want one of the buttons to be se lected initially, you can call\\nsetSelected(true) for that button. If you don’t do this, then none of the buttons will be\\nselected until the user clicks on one of them.\\nAs an example, here is how you could set up a set of radio button s that can be used to\\nselect a color:\\nJRadioButton redRadio, blueRadio, greenRadio, blackRadi o;\\n// Variables to represent the radio buttons.\\n// These should probably be instance variables, so\\n// that they can be used throughout the program.\\nButtonGroup colorGroup = new ButtonGroup();' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 654}\n",

Just as for checkboxes, it is not always nece ssary\\nto register listeners for radio buttons.

A key stroke consists of pressing a key, poss ibly while holding down one or\\nmore of the modiﬁer keys control ,shift ,alt, andmeta. The KeyStroke class has a static\\nmethod,getKeyStroke(String) , that makes it easy to create key stroke objects. For example ,\\nKeyStroke.getKeyStroke( \"ctrl S\" )\\nreturns a KeyStroke that represents the action of pressing the “S” key while hold ing down the\\ncontrol key.

When the key stroke involves pressing a character key, the character must appear in the\\nstring in upper case form. You can also have key strokes that c orrespond to non-character keys.\\nThe number keys can be referred to as “1”, “2”, etc., while cer tain special keys have names\\nsuch as “F1”, “ENTER”, and “LEFT” (for the left arrow key).

Ideally, an object\\nshould have a single, clearly deﬁned role, with a limited rea lm of responsibility. One application\\nof this principle to the design of graphical user interfaces is theMVC pattern . “MVC” stands\\nfor “Model-View-Controller” and refers to three diﬀerent r ealms of responsibility in the design\\nof a graphical user interface.\\nWhen the MVC pattern is applied to a component, the model consists of the data that\\nrepresents the current state of the component. The view is simply the visual presentation of\\nthe component on the screen. And the controller is the aspect of the component that carries\\nout actions in response to events generated by the user. The i dea is to assign responsibility for' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 661}\n",

The i dea is to assign responsibility for\\nthe model, the view, and the controller to diﬀerent objects.\\nThe view is the easiest part of the MVC pattern to understand. It is often represented by\\nthe component object itself, and its responsibility is to dr aw the component on the screen. In\\ndoing this, of course, it has to consult the model, since the m odel represents the state of the\\ncomponent, and that state can determine what appears on the s creen. To get at the model\\ndata—which is stored in a separate object according to the MV C pattern—the component\\nobject needs to keep a reference to the model object. Further more, when the model changes,\\nthe view might have to be redrawn to reﬂect the changed state. The component needs some way\\nof knowing when changes in the model occur. Typically, in Jav a, this is done with events and\\nlisteners. The model object is set up to generate events when its data changes. The view object' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 661}\n",

When the mod el changes, an event is generated,\\nthe view is notiﬁed of that event, and the view responds by upd ating its appearance on the\\nscreen.\\nWhen MVC is used for Swing components, the controller is gene rally not so well deﬁned as\\nthe model and view, and its responsibilities are often split among several objects. The controller\\nmight include mouse and keyboard listeners that respond to u ser events on the view; Actions\\nthat respond to menu commands or buttons; and listeners for o ther high-level events, such as\\nthose from a slider, that aﬀect the state of the component. Us ually, the controller responds\\nto events by making modiﬁcations to the model, and the view is changed only indirectly, in\\nresponse to the changes in the model.\\nThe MVC pattern is used in many places in the design of Swing.

A JTextComponent displays text that can, optionally, be edited by the user. Tw o\\nsubclasses, JTextField andJTextArea , were introduced in Subsection 6.6.4. But the real com-\\nplexity comes in another subclass, JEditorPane , that supports display and editing of styled text,\\nwhich allows features such as boldface and italic.

URLs and content\\ntypes were covered in Subsection 11.4.1.) If editPane is of type JEditorPane andurlis of type\\nURL, then the statement “ editPane.setPage(url); ” is suﬃcient to load the page and display\\nit. Since this can generate an exception, the following meth od is used in SimpleWebBrowser.java\\nto display a page:\\nprivate void loadURL(URL url) {\\ntry {\\neditPane.setPage(url);\\n}\\ncatch (Exception e) {\\neditPane.setContentType(\"text/plain\"); // Set pane to di splay plain text.\\neditPane.setText( \"Sorry, the requested document was not f ound\\\\n\"\\n+\"or cannot be displayed.\\\\n\\\\nError:\" + e);\\n}\\n}' metadata={'source': 'javanotes5.pdf', 'page': 669}\n",

Sometimes, if you are lucky, you don’t need such free dom, and you can build on one of\\nJava’s more sophisticated component classes.\\nFor example, suppose I have a need for a “stopwatch” componen t.

We can get this behavior by d eﬁning a\\nStopWatchLabel component as a subclass of the JLabel class. A StopWatchLabel object will\\nlisten for mouse clicks on itself. The ﬁrst time the user clic ks, it will change its display to\\n“Timing...” and remember the time when the click occurred.
